### **Siriunox Manifesto**  

This project draws inspiration from the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto and the libertarian spirit of Richard M. Stallman.  
Its purpose is to provide ordinary individuals with a secure tool against digital threats.  
In the 21st century, digital transformation is reshaping the world‚Äîbut not always for the better.  

Carbon taxes, social credit scores, centralized digital identities, and the abolition of cash are weaving a web that restricts fundamental human freedoms.  
SRX is a decentralized, ownerless, and fixed-supply digital asset created for those who wish to remain outside this system.  

It is **not** an investment vehicle or a speculative asset.  

‚Ä¢ SRX has no owner, company, or authority behind it.  
‚Ä¢ Its developers are anonymous.  
‚Ä¢ This project does not belong to any individual, group, or corporation.  
‚Ä¢ If people adopt, use, and carry it, SRX will thrive‚Äîotherwise, it will fade away. But it **cannot be corrupted**.

### ‚ùì Why SRX? Aren‚Äôt Bitcoin or Monero Enough?  

SRX does not seek to compete with major projects; it aims to provide a unique solution where they fall short.  

‚Ä¢ **Bitcoin** is **traceable and increasingly subject to government surveillance and censorship.**  
‚Ä¢ **Monero** is **private but complex and banned in many regions.**  
‚Ä¢ SRX strives to **preserve dignity, economic freedom, and privacy under legal pressure.**

### üî¢ Token Economics  

‚Ä¢ **Total supply:** 80,000,000 SRX  

SRX‚Äôs total supply is based on a symbolic yet practical model derived from the maximum potential human population (12 billion).  
This number is linked to the combined value of global gold and silver reserves using a 1:21 ratio.  

This is not merely a technical calculation‚Äîit represents SRX‚Äôs stance on **economic freedom and individual sovereignty.**  
The model ensures that everyday transactions (like buying a liter of olive oil) can be conducted with user-friendly decimals, avoiding meaningless micropayments like *0.000000123*.  

However, this model only achieves its true purpose if embraced by a **non-profit community**, as defined in the manifesto.  
Its goal is to provide every individual with a secure tool against the complexities and dangers of the digital world.

### üí∞ How to Obtain SRX  

‚Ä¢ **SRX is not traded on exchanges.**  
‚Ä¢ It is **minted directly via a smart contract** with predefined, immutable rules.  
For detailed instructions, please refer to the **EN_USER_GUIDE_HOW_TO_MINT** file.  
Ethereum‚Äôs foundational security and Arbitrum‚Äôs efficiency are combined to ensure long-term sustainability.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Original Contract vs. Fake Forks  

Since SRX exists on a public blockchain, anyone can fork its contract, copy its code, and launch similar projects under the same name.  
This is a natural part of open-source culture.  

However, such copies **do not reflect SRX‚Äôs core philosophy**:  
- Open to all  
- Non-profit  
- Resistant to speculative manipulation  
- Fixed total supply  

**Users must interact only with the original contract:**  

**Official Contract Address:**  
0xAE4E8d3C1537bA41160e69B8daf0eA8A86c14Da4 *(Arbitrum One Network)*  

SRX was born as a stance against centralized control systems.  
**No one who tries to manipulate it truly represents its ideals.**
